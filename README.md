# Odeon: Nomic on Github

This repository represents a game of
[Nomic](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm) where the bookkeeping of
the rules and possibly the scores is done through Markdown flavored text files.

The `initial` branch represents a base repository that contains only the initial
verbatim rules of Nomic.

The `github` branch represents a proposed version of the game with immutable
rules, mutable rules added, and one mutable rule modified in order that the
game can conceivably be played on Github.

The `master` branch contains the currently active game of Odeon.
