Every player is an eligible voter.

If the number of votes on a rule-change reaches a number sufficient for
adoption, the proponent of the rule-change has the option to merge and close
the pull request at that time, without waiting for all eligible voters to
participate.

For example, if the rules say that a rule-change is adopted by a simple
majority vote, and there are 3 players, then the proponent may merge and close
as long as there are two +1 votes.

When this option is exercised, players who did not already vote are counted as
having voted against.
