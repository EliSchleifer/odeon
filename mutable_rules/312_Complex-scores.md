Every score is a complex number. Every point value is a complex number.
Every complex number is the sum of a real part, being a real number, with an
imaginary part, being an imaginary number. Every imaginary number is a multiple
of the square root of -1. 

Imaginary numbers may be specified with a suffix of "i" after a real number
representing the multiple. For example, "3i" means the same thing as "3 times
the square root of -1". Complex numbers may be specified in the following ways:
(A) as just a real part like "2", equivalent to the same real part plus 0i,
(B) as just an imaginary part like "3i", equivalent to the same imaginary part
    plus 0,
(C) or as a real part plus an imaginary part like "2 + 3i".

Thus, "2" has the same meaning as "2 + 0i" and is a valid specification of
a complex number.
