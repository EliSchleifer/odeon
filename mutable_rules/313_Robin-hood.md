If, at the end of a player's turn, he or she has more points than the other
players combined, that player shall lose 10 points for every other player in the
game. Each other player simultaneously gains 10 points each. For the purposes of
this rule, if scores and points are complex numbers, the real part and
imaginary part are considered separately.
